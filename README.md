# Awesome-Agentic-AI-for-Healthcare
 
![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-Welcome-green)  [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This repository is a curated list of research papers, projects, and resources related to the application of **agentic AI for healthcare**. Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environment, often through the use of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems.

We will try to make this list updated. If you found any error or any missed paper, please don't hesitate to open issues or pull requests.
